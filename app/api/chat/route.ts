Cash flow = Money coming in - Money going out

**Three Types of Cash Flow:**
1. **Operating**: Day-to-day business activities
2. **Investing**: Equipment, property purchases
3. **Financing**: Loans, investments, owner contributions

**Improving Cash Flow:**

**1. Speed Up Incoming Cash**
- Send invoices immediately
- Offer early payment discounts
- Accept multiple payment methods
- Follow up on overdue payments

**2. Slow Down Outgoing Cash**
- Negotiate payment terms with suppliers
- Use credit cards strategically (30-day float)
- Pay bills on time, not early
- Consider leasing instead of buying

**3. Monitor Regularly**
- Create cash flow projections
- Track accounts receivable aging
- Maintain emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Review monthly cash flow statements

**4. Cash Flow Tools:**
- QuickBooks, Xero, or FreshBooks
- Simple spreadsheet tracking
- Bank account monitoring
- Regular financial reviews

**5. Warning Signs:**
- Late payments to suppliers
- Maxed out credit cards
- Difficulty paying bills
- Declining bank balance

**üí° Pro Tip**: Upload bank statements or financial reports, and I can help analyze your cash flow patterns!
